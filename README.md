Install **[LidRun](https://lidrun.com)** with Homebrew — the macOS menu-bar app that [keeps your Mac awake](https://lidrun.com) with the **lid closed**, so Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Docker and Ollama keep running while you step away. It releases the Mac automatically when the work is done or when battery/thermal limits are reached.

## Install

```sh
brew install --cask aibrickai/lidrun/lidrun
```

This one-line form auto-adds the tap and installs LidRun. Homebrew 6+ refuses a
third-party tap until you trust it once, so if you hit
`Refusing to load cask ... from untrusted tap`, run it as:

```sh
brew trust aibrickai/lidrun
brew install --cask aibrickai/lidrun/lidrun
```

Prefer to tap first? `brew tap aibrickai/lidrun` then `brew install --cask lidrun`
works the same.

The DMG is **Developer-ID signed and Apple-notarized**, so it installs with no
Gatekeeper workaround — and LidRun keeps itself up to date via Sparkle. Prefer a
direct download instead? Grab it from **[lidrun.com/download](https://lidrun.com/download)**.

## What you get

LidRun is a safe **runtime layer**, not just an anti-sleep toggle:

- **Closed-lid workflow** — a guarded [clamshell mode](https://lidrun.com) with no external display, so an agent or build survives the moment you shut the lid.
- **Auto Mode** — holds the Mac awake only while real work is running (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Ollama, Docker, long builds), then lets it sleep.
- **Guardrails** — low-battery auto-stop, charging-only mode, thermal back-off, and a 30 min–8 h session timer.
- **`lidrun` CLI** — `lidrun -- <command>` keeps the Mac awake for exactly one job, then releases it.
- **Why Awake / Why Stopped** — full transparency on every keep-awake decision, plus optional push notifications.

Free forever for simple keep-awake sessions — no trial, no subscription. [Pricing](https://lidrun.com/pricing).

## Requirements

- macOS 13 (Ventura) or later — Apple Silicon or Intel.
- Homebrew ([brew.sh](https://brew.sh)).

## Update

```sh
brew update
brew upgrade --cask lidrun
```

Existing installs also update themselves in the background via Sparkle, so this is
optional — the cask only gates the first install.

## Uninstall

```sh
brew uninstall --cask lidrun          # remove the app
brew uninstall --zap --cask lidrun    # also remove LidRun's local data
```

LidRun installs a privileged helper for its closed-lid and safety features. `--zap`
removes user files but can't remove that system helper — turn LidRun off in
**System Settings → General → Login Items & Extensions** before uninstalling to
remove it fully.
